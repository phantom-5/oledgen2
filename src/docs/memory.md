# Development Memory

## OLED Grid Implementation

### Challenge
- Creating a responsive 128x64 grid that works on all device sizes was challenging due to the large number of pixels (8,192 total).

### Solution
- Used CSS scaling (transform: scale()) on smaller screens to maintain pixel visibility
- Implemented scrolling containers to handle overflow
- Set appropriate sizes for each pixel element to balance visibility and overall size

## GFX Code Generation

### Challenge
- Generating efficient GFX code that minimizes individual pixel drawing calls.

### Solution
- Implemented algorithms to detect horizontal and vertical lines
- Processed the grid to use drawLine() for consecutive pixels
- Used drawPixel() only for isolated pixels
- Created a deep copy of the pixel data to avoid modifying the original in Redux

## Theme Implementation

### Challenge
- Ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application in both light and dark modes.

### Solution
- Used MUI's ThemeProvider for consistent theming
- Created dedicated theme slice in Redux
- Ensured color contrasts work well in both themes
- Custom styled component borders and backgrounds based on theme mode

## TypeScript Integration

### Challenge
- Converting the React application to TypeScript while ensuring all components and functions are properly typed.

### Solution
- Created proper interfaces for Redux state
- Added type declarations for CSS modules
- Implemented proper typing for all components and functions
- Used generics for reusable functions to maintain type safety

## Save/Load Functionality

### Challenge
- Implementing persistent storage of designs with proper user interface for managing saved designs.

### Solution
- Used localStorage API for persistent storage of designs
- Created SavedDesign interface to ensure proper typing
- Implemented Redux actions for saving, loading, and deleting designs
- Added error handling for localStorage operations
- Created a user-friendly interface for managing saved designs with proper feedback

## Image Export Functionality

### Challenge
- Creating a way to export the OLED grid as a high-quality image with customizable settings.

### Solution
- Used HTML Canvas API to draw the OLED pixels as an image
- Implemented configurable pixel size for different resolution outputs
- Created an asynchronous export function that returns a Promise with the image data
- Added error handling for the image generation process
- Provided user feedback during the export process with status updates

## Drawing Tools Implementation

### Challenge
- Implementing interactive drawing tools for lines, rectangles, and circles with real-time preview.

### Solution
- Used Bresenham's line algorithm and midpoint circle algorithm for efficient pixel plotting
- Created a preview system that shows the shape being drawn without committing to the final pixel state
- Implemented mouse events (down, move, up) to handle interactive drawing
- Added cancellation mechanisms (escape key and mouse leave) for better user experience
- Separated drawing state from the actual pixel data to maintain clean state management
- Implemented optimized point calculation for previews to maintain good performance

## Flood Fill Implementation

### Challenge
- Implementing an efficient flood fill algorithm that works well for large connected regions without causing stack overflow.

### Solution
- Used a queue-based flood fill algorithm instead of a recursive approach to avoid stack overflow
- Implemented boundary checking to prevent out-of-bounds access
- Optimized the algorithm to only process each pixel once
- Added special UI feedback with a different cursor for the fill tool
- Integrated the fill tool seamlessly with the existing drawing tools UI
- Made the fill tool toggle the pixel state, allowing for both filling and clearing regions
